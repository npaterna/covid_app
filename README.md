# Repository for COVID-19 Tracking App

I built this Shiny application as part of my final project for the class ["Data Science for Biologists"](spielmanlab.github.io/courses/datascience_for_biologists) during my Spring 2020 semester at Rowan University. This application tracks COVID-19 data supplied by the [New York Times](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv) and [John Hopkins University](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/).

This Shiny App is live at [https://npaterna.shinyapps.io/covid19_tracker/](https://npaterna.shinyapps.io/covid19_tracker/) under a **free-tier** [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io) account, therefore only 25 active hours are permitted per month. If the website is down please contact me via Twitter with concerns.
