# COVID-19 App
Repository for COVID Tracking App

In my Spring 2020 semester at Rowan University I co-created a Shiny application with Dr. Stephanie J Spielman to track COVID-19 data supplied by the New York Times and John Hopkins University.

This Shiny App was created as a final assignment for the course and is live under a **free-tier** RStudio account, therefore only 25 active hours are permitted per month. If the website is down please contact me via Twitter with concerns.
